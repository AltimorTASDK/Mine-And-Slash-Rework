So just list all sword items in the "mmorpg:sword" item tag.

* Map Bosses!
A lot of you said maps felt aimless and there was nothing to complete, finish etc.
This update aims to change that in 2 ways.

First, every map now has a boss fight at the end, in their own arena, and to access it, you need to clear 50% of the map at the very least.
There was a lot of code needed to make this completition counter happen btw.. Like mob saving when they despawn.

Now, if you manage to kill the boss, it will spawn a teleport to the reward room!
The reward room will have a set amount of chests with added loot multipliers and better loot tables depending on your map completition %,
that % will be represented in rarities up to mythic.
