Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.7.txt

v.5.7.0
- Spell casting now has custom animations! This requires a new dependency mod: player animator
Spell animations are dictated through each spell's datapack json so you can change them, add new ones etc.
The actual animations file is in the assets\mmorpg\player_animation folder
- Some useless/confusing items are now hidden from JEI, still available in creative tabs
- a lot of spells now have cast time again. But i think it will feel good now with better animations instead of just "wave hand"
- charge gui redesigned
- cast bar gui redesigned
- player is now slowed when casting (like when using an item, unsure if feels the same though)
- hotbar swapping overlay reworked to show all spells but also show which hotbar is the currently used
- overlays can now be disabled
- overlays can now be configured. You can specify positions, disable them, or anchor them to other overlays
- effect overlay can now be horizontal and vertical and attached to other overlays like the spell hotbar 
- attempt to cache some stat calculation for less lag on servers, may be bugs but should be significant perf improvement if it works. At the very least halved the tick lag of players/entities caused by mns stat calc
- map rarity orbs are now craftable
- new entity targetting predicate: allies_not_self
- shooting star now tracks to nearest non self ally and was slightly buffed

PLEASE report any weird animations for spells, or bugs related to them! 
Same with gui overlays and stat calculation.

New Item type and featurE: Omens!

Omens are a 4th curio slot item after necklace and rings but they work differently than normal gear items.
Think of them as set item bonuses. Each omen has a random amount of requirements to unlock the 2,3,4,5 etc piece stat bonuses.
The easiest omens only require you to wear x amount of say unique or runed gear. The harder ones might also require specific gear slots to be equipped with specific rarities of gears.
The harder the omen is to assemble, the bigger the stat bonuses!

The goal of omens is to reward players for equipping different types of gear, instead of punishing them with equip count restrictions.
A lot of players asked for set effects so I wanted to make something that doesn't hurt build diversity but actually helps it.
They don't make or break builds, but are nice thing to hunt for when you're minmaxing for the endgame, and there's easier omens too for the early game.

All the omen requirements are random too.

- slightly nerfed the top corruption outcomes (now gives 1 stat and 1 socket slot, instead of 2 stats)
- fix aura effect and food buff effect stats multiplying stats infinitely
