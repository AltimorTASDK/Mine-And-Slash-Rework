# What are Compat Configs?

These settings exist to switch Mine and Slash from a mostly incompatible mod that a modpack has to revolve around into a very compatible mod that can be placed in any modpack.
If you're confused why this is a thing, read on

# Where are these Configs?

save_folder/serverconfig/mine_and_slash_compatibility-server.toml

# What are the differences between the 2 configs?

| Difference | Compatibility Mode    | Override Mode   |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|  Damage   | Damage is added on top of vanilla damage as bonus damage | Damage is overrided/replaced and if the damage is invalid type, it is cancelled |
| Stat Scaling | Very Low stat scalings, you won't gain that much health, damage etc, but mobs won't either | Very high stat scaling, mob health will be in millions in endgame |
| Spell Cast Weapon | No weapon requirement for spells | Spells have weapon requirements |
| Vanilla Health Regen | Enabled plus you have mns health regen stat | Replaced with Mns health regen stat |
| Mob Damage | Mobs get a slight amount of bonus damage | Mobs get a lot of extra damage |

# What Config is best for me?

If you are making a modpack focusing entirely on Mine and Slash, then the override config might be better:
- this config makes sure you can kill mobs only with damage Mine and slash allows, so you only need to balance mine and Slash
- you don't have to worry about the balance of other mods, whether they add a single OP item, spell etc
- because only mns deals damage, balancing becomes easier
- Stat scalings are higher, so leveling matters a lot more and it feels more like an rpg

If your modpack doesn't revolve around Mine and Slash, an you have other spell mods in there, the compat mode is probably better:
- Your other spell mods will work
- Mine and Slash will no longer be required for progression and to kill mobs (depends on stat scalings though)
- the gui overlays bars will try hide when full or not needed
