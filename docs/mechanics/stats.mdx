## What are Stats?

Stats, or Usually called Mns Stats are separate from Vanilla Attributes and are used for pretty much everything Mine and Slash.

## Stat Modifier Types

When you get a stat, from say a talent tree point, you always get 1 out of 3 types of a stat:
- +5 Health, a flat stat bonus
- +5% Health, an additive percentage increase, all the % health bonuses are summed up later
- +5% More Health, a multiplicative increase, each "More" modifier becomes its own multiplier.

An example:
- 0 Base health
- +100 Health
- +50% health, +50% health
- +10% More health, +10% more health

Result:
- 100 * 2 * 1.1 * 1.1
- 200 * 1.1 * 1.1
- 220 * 1.1
- 242
