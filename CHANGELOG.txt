Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.9.txt

v.5.9.11

- fixed infusion reroll
- added if_false field to spell conditions, to flip the condition
- added is_optional field to spell conditions, optional conditions work as "any"
3 optionals and 1 passes: works
2 optionals and 1 non optional, if the non-optional fails, it wont work, even if the optionals pass
- enchant compat caps are now per player (might be buggy)
- added per_item_max and min to enchant compat to still be able to cap stuff per item
- tried to fix map item config bans not working
- fixed item_mod command to actually work
- map upgrade screen should show fail reason now correctly 
- removed mythic gear crafting recipes. Any way i thought of to make crafting equal to drops just doesn't work.
I tried to make some currencies only usable on non-crafted items, i tried upping the crafting cost, reducing potential... nobody liked any of it.
So i'm removing crafting of mythic gear. Crafting is still useful during 90% of the game and at endgame there's still sharpening stones that are a must.
I thought of further increasing the crafting cost but i think just removing them from the equation will be less trouble.
Crafting was always meant as an additional cool thing to do, if it ever makes drops meaningless expect it to get nerfed.
I'm always open to suggestions as long as they meet these 2 things: 1) crafting shouldn't make loot drops worthless 2) I am not open to buffing loot drops to compete with current OP-ness of crafting
As always, most of the mod are datapacks, so you're free to edit whatever.
- attempt to fix boss scroll teleport bug
- gear now shows base stat % and value when shift is on
- spells that share supp gems now also share innate spell stats
