- small rename of command reset_player_data > reset player_data
- MODPACK WARNING: all point types like (talents, spells etc) are now in the game balance datapack! 
They now use the same system so i can more easily allow stuff like bonus points for stuff besides talents. (bonus talent points will be preserved for now as legacy code)
