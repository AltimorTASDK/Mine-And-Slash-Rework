v.5.1.0

- added more types of loot chests

- rarities are now gated behind levels

- spell gem max links are now capped behind their rarity

- implemented logic that caps stat scaling of non weapon damage sources of damage to spells, like mana. Now lightning spells scale with say 100% weapon damage, and can only add up to 100% of weapon damage as mana damage.
This should ensure spells with any type of stat scalings can't become too op, but it also easily allows me to buff them if they are weak.

- added XP debt system. Dying now adds a stacking xp gain penalty that reduces xp gain by 50% until it's exhausted, in the future i will probably add items that remove the xp debt in some other way, like crafting.

- added experimental in combat regeneration decrease, will see how it feels and if it's right for the mod

- aura cost reduction > aura capacity, instead of reducing aura cost, you will now gain aura capacity with stats. This is intended to simplify the stat
