v.5.5.29
- datapack warnings are now printed to each player that logs in, but only a short summary
- unbound key should now show that and not just "N"
- new feature: everyone is ally. When spells target only allies, this means they will target anything
- reset spell cooldowns command now merged with other reset player data commands
- small rename of command reset_player_data > reset player_data
- MODPACK WARNING: all point types like (talents, spells etc) are now in the game balance datapack! 
They now use the same system so i can more easily allow stuff like bonus points for stuff besides talents. (bonus talent points will be preserved for now as legacy code)
Previously point configs were spread to both configs and datapacks, and each used different methods..
- added give and reset bonus point commands to all point types now, removed the old talent point commands
