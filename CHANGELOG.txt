Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.9.txt

v.5.9.24

- fixed omens not respecting slot requirements completely
- changed basic atk cooldown to hopefully work better
- bonus dmg should now work with dmg multipliers, before it wasnt being lowered by attacking too fast for example
- reworked damage conversion to happen after additive damage layers 
- bonus phys as elemental dmg now works after flat dmg was added and after conversions
- so base dmg + flat dmg > converts to x > bonus x as y
Needs updating the stat layers in stat datapacks, and make sure the priorities are correct
- ailments can now proc from either hit or bonus dmg
