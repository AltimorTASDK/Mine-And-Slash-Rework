Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.9.txt

v.5.9.20

- uber frags can now only drop 1 per boss. You should need to clear multiple maps to assemble a single uber map
- bosses and uber mob rarities now have CC resistance spell they auto cast every few seconds, removing a negative effect from themselves
- higher rar mobs now have chill/slow resistance, for example you can no longer stun a boss with chill
- fixed remove negative effect spell action
- very high lvl mobs now show a skull and hide their level
- Ailment code changed, now ailments are per player/mob. So Each player doing poison damage will have their own poison damages etc. 
Also, mobs should now be able to do damage with ailments too. Might be buggy, please test
- ailments are no longer saved to entity nbt, i dont think its needed
- blocking sound added
- added new on_death event for stats. Also to make this actually work, all mns stat events now work with dead mobs, this surely won't cause any bugs
