v.5.5.27
- datapacks are now checked and a warning is printed to console if the json you used in a datapack is different from the json the class serializes back to.
What this means is, mns should give you a warning that one of your datapacks is faulty, like:
- it will warn if you used a field that doesn't exist
- it will warn if you didn't use all the existing fields

It won't actually tell you what's wrong but for now it just tells you SOMETHING is wrong with that specific json and shows you a comparison.

- datapacks now default to loader = "REPLACE_FULLY", if you want to only replace some values, use REPLACE_FIELDS
Full replace means it loads the json and turns it into a new class. Replace fields means it only replaces the fields you put in the json
