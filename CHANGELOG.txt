Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.6.txt

v.5.6.6
- Spell casting now has custom animations! This requires a new dependency mod: player animator
Spell animations are dictated through each spell's datapack json so you can change them, add new ones etc.
The actual animations file is in the assets\mmorpg\player_animation folder
- Some useless/confusing items are now hidden from JEI, still available in creative tabs
- charge gui redesigned
- cast bar gui redesigned
- player is now slowed when casting (like when using an item, unsure if feels the same though)
- hotbar swapping overlay reworked to show all spells but also show which hotbar is the currently used
