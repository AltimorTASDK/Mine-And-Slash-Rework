Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.9.txt

v.5.9.19

- rarities that force custom hp now use that hp to determine loot multi
- reduced default max items when loot generates to 20
- max mob hp loot multi is now 10
- destroy item now works correctly as an item mod
- auto aiming projectiles should be slightly less laggy now
- redid some error messages so they are less vague, instead of "lvl too low", it will now be: Support gem equip fail: lvl too low. 
Please tell if any error messages are still vague
