v.5.5.0

Another big update which brings Ascendancy classes!
These are ways to define your build even further, whether you want to be a Curse specialist, a bard, mana stacker, aurabot, a hybrid..

There are currently 14(TM) Ascendancy classes:
- Arcanist
- Death Lich
- Chieftain
- Champion
- Raider
- Hunter
- Trickster
- Assassin
- Necromancer
- Elementalist
- Guardian
- Battlemage
- Jester
- Ascendant

There will be more classes in the future, but even if a class you want is missing, there are quite a few general classes that can be played in many ways.
Some classes focus more on defenses, some on offenses. Some have ways of exploding killed enemies etc.

Reminder, as these are also datapacks, don't be suprised a modpack has additional custom classes!

Misc:
- your talents should be wiped (allocate them again)
- for datapackers: is_dodged is no longer used by both block and dodge, now there's a special is_hit_avoided that all things that make the hit avoid call, but you can also check if is_dodged or is_blocked
- golems now give you a buff when they attack anything
- added stat for "plus stat per effect stacks on you", mahj will know
- added optional mob kill text that that also has a helpful hover text that shows how was loot chance modified
This should hopefully resolve any "why no loot drop" confusion
- added optional mob damage text. (THIS SHOWS ALL THE DAMAGE CALCULATIONS!!! VERY USEFUL ESPECIALLY FOR DEBUGGING!!!)
This tells you all about how you dealt that much damage, or why the mob dealt so much damage to you!!!
If something doesn't feel right, report it. The calculations are done top to bottom, so first flat damage is added (if any), and then its multiplied.
Additive damage increase is most damage stats like "+ fire damage" all added up into 1 multiplier. 
At the end there are "dmg multipliers", these come from "more fire damage" things, these are multiplied with each other and therefore all separate.
It tells you how your damage is converted, added, multiplied etc
Not all code uses this system yet, so it could either be a damage bug, or a tooltip bug, either way report it
Whenever you want to report a damage bug, please screenshot the bugged damage with this!
- added is_bonus_element_damage boolean for damage data, this way you can avoid adding flat damage boosts to bonus damages
- made block chance not require shields, I feel it's too constricting that an entire defense layer needs a specific item?
- added some new supp gems
- temporarily removed the bonus ele dmg from mobs, but uncommon mobs now have 1 affix instead of 0
Will monitor player tankiness after ascendancy release
- added new item corruptions
- item corruptions cant be same 2 affixes now
