Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.8.txt

v.5.8.3

- added builder utility commands to load all of a dungeon's structure blocks. 
Should be useful when testing or fixing dungeons: /mine_and_slash builder_tool_warning generate_dungeon_pieces
- map device now drops when broken
- crafted gear is now labeled
- gear souls now provide error messages when trying to apply to incorrect item types
- removed the complex mob processor (the 'spawn;rarity;mobtype' one), it will now just delegate to normal `mob` processor, 
this means maps should now hopefully have more modded mobs (if datapack-ed in) instead of zombies and skellies
- stats like "more x per y" and intellect% etc should now benefit from % modifiers. So 5 hp per 1 dodge should now benefit from both hp and dodge, and intellect % should increase mana etc
WARNING, this bugfix will probably boost player power quite a bit! Probably a good idea to nerf % int etc sources
