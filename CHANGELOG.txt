Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.9.txt

v.5.9.36

- removed lock button from salvage station
- downgrade map now has a cooldown of 5 minutes
- starting a new map also has a cooldown of 3 minutes
These cooldowns are to stop the abuse of generating tons of maps to search for best layouts.
They shouldn't really impact genuine play
