Start of Release builds!
Mine and Slash 1.20.1 is finally at a point where I don't feel BETA suits it that well anymore, as it's very very close to ready to actually play and not just test.
A lot of bugs have been ironed out, gui and items received a generous makeover, mechanics have been polished, tweaked.
Localization has been added to more and more parts of the code. Lots of small updates that didn't feel like they added much, added up I guess!

v.5.3.14
- should fix effect tooltips 
- talents now lower opacity when players have 0 talents, to show which are the starter ones
- fix double soul modifier use
- fix soul mod use on non armors
- healing no longer causes threat
- try optimize stat calc a biiiit
- try optimize syncing to client a bit
If you notice anything weird after update please say
- /mine_and_slash reset_player_data to reset parts of a player
- added status effect wiki
- added blizzard spell
- added chat explanation for ANY reason your spell cast might fail :)
Some are excluded like like low cooldown spammable spells wont screech at you for holding the button, but if the cooldown is higher than 2 seconds than it will gladly tell you
- added hurt sound on magic shield being hit
- tweaked item click on other code, please check for any errors
- currencies shouldnt move items around in inventory anymore
- added set_health_damage_override to entityconfig datapack for stubborn closed source mods that mess with damage mechanics and dont provide configs. Yes i see the irony
- added buttons for choosen spell schools
- blue skies added as default datapack (to override damage)
- added new spell datapack mechanic, derives level from spell. This combined with new spell proc stat, means you can say have a buff you can lvl up, and the buff would provide a stat that procs a spell that isn't in the 
actual spell school or learnable at all, and that procced spell's lvl will be based on the buff spell level
- added some new stat conditions like is ailment, has effect
- added lich armor buff, this will define the dps frost mage playstyle. Shattering enemies, and unleashing devastating aoe damage upon reaching max frost essence stacks

- added mob and item lvl variance configs

v.5.3.16
