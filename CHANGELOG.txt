v.5.5.26
- Item inventory interactions (the drag and click) now work on left click and right click again. 
The lack of left click interactions was confusing some people and it didn't seem to fix problems with sort mods anyway
- effect bars now dont overlap with 8bar hotbar
- cast fail messages are now forced on level 10 players and below
- small loc fixes
