Start of Release builds!
Mine and Slash 1.20.1 is finally at a point where I don't feel BETA suits it that well anymore, as it's very very close to ready to actually play and not just test.
A lot of bugs have been ironed out, gui and items received a generous makeover, mechanics have been polished, tweaked.
Localization has been added to more and more parts of the code. Lots of small updates that didn't feel like they added much, added up I guess!

v.5.3.9
- picking a hotbar spell now returns you to skill gem screens/gui
- talent tree makeover
- fix totem duration stat
- tweaked pet targetting
- maps now gen larger radius around you but limit generation to 3 chunks per tick (will this help, not sure)
- you can now use cloth etc soul modifiers that make it so your soul item always creates cloth gear for example
- datapack change, spell config now uses taglist instead of array
- you now lose half of your rested xp on death
- tweaked some regen base stats
- reworked a lot of TAG CODE, datapack devs warning
- chained spells now do less dmg per chain, up to configurable minimum
- profession stations now fill up the output slots BUT any recipes with more than 1 output will throw items on the ground, so use hoppers anyway
- should fix move speed stat crash
- now requires the latest exile lib 1.4.0 because it fixes an important bug
- gem stats now scale to lvl (the ones that can)
- added new req_type arg to tag req datapacks, if INCLUDES_ANY it means affix can be on any item with that tag, if HAS_ALL it needs to have all the tags, no changes to jsons needed i think for most use cases
- removed special names for items with more than 2 affixes, now uses the strongest of each, prefix and suffix for names. Think it's better this way 
- added tags for each specific base gear like leather_helmet
- items can now have implicit stats and change their name accordingly, this should make low rarity gear a bit more interesting
- heavily nerfed jewel stats, they were meant to be slight help to gearing, not a complete solution to resistances
- normal jewels now have more possible affixes
- added give jewel command
- EXPERIMENTAL characters feature. You can now save/load different builds by leveling new characters. Probably has a few bugs, might need some tweaking, currently
the only limitation is you can't change classes in the map dimension and when in combat, but there might still be exploits I didn't think of
