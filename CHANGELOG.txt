v.5.4.0
- added a /mine_and_slash report map_problem command
- fixed the missing crop stage requirement for all the crops and professions.. 
- added config in main hub for cast fail msgs
- removed auto pve server config, it's now a per player config in the main hub config section, if 2 players both have auto pve on, they will be automatically grouped, won't be able to damage each other etc.
This is meant for players who don't want to mess with inviting to parties etc
- fix harvest generation/tp issues
- runed items now have a min drop lvl
- attempt fix double death xp loss etc
- improved hotbar ui a bit
- datapack thing: effects can now NOT stack stat buffs per effect stack amount and effects can now decrease their stack count by 1 if casted with a tagged spell.
This will be used for missile barrage talent. It gives you cast speed and dmg to any missile tag spell, but the buff stacks are reduced by 1 every time you cast any missile tag spell.

- rune reroll now cant roll stat into lower value than it was before, roll away!
- fixed the tooltips a bit, now correctly cuts lines only if there is too many (before it counted double blank lines that were removed anyway)
- added a new system, map resist requirements. Maps of higher rarity and difficulty now require some baseline of elemental resistances to actually enter,
which should hopefully reduce the amount of complaints about one shots. 
Maps that have elemental mob damage affixes require higher resists
If there's some unique way to mitigate elemental damage in the future, like a stat that reduces say Fire damage received by 90%, i'll have to include to allow it to bypass the requirement system.
- making a bigger runeword on top of a smaller one now overwites the smaller one
- simplified Currencies and item potential. It now acts as the opposite of instability in earlier versions.
Now your item starts with say 100 potential and you spend potential to use currencies on the item, at 0 potential, you can't use any more currencies on the item.
The system was too confusing and nobody knew what it was. It was meant to be a less restrictive system that just reduced your chances of good outcomes the more you crafted but, 
I decided to just go back to the old system where you either can or can't craft an item anymore.

New Feature, Prophecies:

Killing Mobs in maps now rewards favor currency which can be spent to buy prophecy rewards.
Prophecy rewards are a way to target farm things! You can buy stuff like "3 Epic Boots" or "5 runes".
The higher mob lvl and tier you kill while filling up the progress bar, the higher lvl and tier rewards you will have at the end.
The more specific the reward, the costlier it is. A Sword reward is more expensive than an any gear reward etc
To encourage tankier playstyles, dying in maps now reduces both your prophecy progress bar and takes a huge chunk of your currency away.

Chaos stats added back

Added a new system for compatibility between vanilla and mns stats.
The system is simple, you create a datapack that for example:
- makes it so each point of vanilla armor gives you +3% mine and slash armor
- maybe another rpg mod has a fire damage stat, you can make that stat give you mine and slash Fire damage % etc

You can make it give flat amounts that scale per player level or percentages that don't need scaling.
You can even add caps in case you don't want the attribute to give too much of the stat endgame
