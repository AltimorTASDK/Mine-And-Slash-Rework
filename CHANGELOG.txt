v.5.7.4

New Item type and featurE: Omens!

Omens are a 4th curio slot item after necklace and rings but they work differently than normal gear items.
Think of them as set item bonuses. Each omen has a random amount of requirements to unlock the 2,3,4,5 etc piece stat bonuses.
The easiest omens only require you to wear x amount of say unique or runed gear. The harder ones might also require specific gear slots to be equipped with specific rarities of gears.
The harder the omen is to assemble, the bigger the stat bonuses!

The goal of omens is to reward players for equipping different types of gear, instead of punishing them with equip count restrictions.
A lot of players asked for set effects so I wanted to make something that doesn't hurt build diversity but actually helps it.
They don't make or break builds, but are nice thing to hunt for when you're minmaxing for the endgame, and there's easier omens too for the early game.

All the omen requirements are random too.

- slightly nerfed the top corruption outcomes (now gives 1 stat and 1 socket slot, instead of 2 stats)
