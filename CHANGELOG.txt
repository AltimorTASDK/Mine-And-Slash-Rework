v.5.2.0

CLASS rework BETA:

* in short: skill gems no longer drop (support gems and auras do), instead you get spells by allocating points into classes.
- the class trees will have additional passives later, this is WIP
- basically class system + support gems + aura gems. Hopefully best of both worlds.

- fix mobs not being able to damage each other

- weapon energy costs now have energy per swing and per mob attacked, to balance weapon's between aoe and single target weapons if modpacks want.
The per swing is not exactly per swing, but more per hit + with added cooldown, so it won't cost anything when you fire the bow, only when the arrow hits a mob.
For swords it will work like this:
You attack 3 zombies. The first zombie you spend energy per swing and it's now set on tiny cooldown,
for second zombie it's on cd so not spent, etc. For all 3 zombies you spend the "per mob attacked" energy cost.
Depending on the ratio of per swing vs per mob costs the weapon can be either good at single target or aoe.

- gear base stats should now be per rarity, instead of same for all rarities

- fixed commands breaking after /reload

- fixed elemental resists doubling resists

- fix breed event null

- fix recoil shot shooting you forward
