v.5.5.0

Another big update which brings Ascendancy classes!
These are ways to define your build even further, whether you want to be a Curse specialist, a bard, mana stacker, aurabot, a hybrid..

You get a point every 10 levels, and you can't have more than 9 points in total.

There are currently 14(TM) Ascendancy classes:
- Arcanist
- Death Lich
- Chieftain
- Champion
- Raider
- Hunter
- Trickster
- Assassin
- Necromancer
- Elementalist
- Guardian
- Battlemage
- Jester
- Ascendant

There will be more classes in the future, but even if a class you want is missing, there are quite a few general classes that can be played in many ways.
Some classes focus more on defenses, some on offenses. Some have ways of exploding killed enemies etc.

Reminder, as these are also datapacks, don't be suprised a modpack has additional custom classes!

Misc:
- your talents should be wiped (allocate them again)
- for datapackers: is_dodged is no longer used by both block and dodge, now there's a special is_hit_avoided that all things that make the hit avoid call, but you can also check if is_dodged or is_blocked
- golems now give you a buff when they attack anything
- added stat for "plus stat per effect stacks on you", mahj will know
- added optional mob kill text that that also has a helpful hover text that shows how was loot chance modified
This should hopefully resolve any "why no loot drop" confusion
- added optional mob damage text. (THIS SHOWS ALL THE DAMAGE CALCULATIONS!!! VERY USEFUL ESPECIALLY FOR DEBUGGING!!!)
This tells you all about how you dealt that much damage, or why the mob dealt so much damage to you!!!
If something doesn't feel right, report it. The calculations are done top to bottom, so first flat damage is added (if any), and then its multiplied.
Additive damage increase is most damage stats like "+ fire damage" all added up into 1 multiplier. 
At the end there are "dmg multipliers", these come from "more fire damage" things, these are multiplied with each other and therefore all separate.
It tells you how your damage is converted, added, multiplied etc
Not all code uses this system yet, so it could either be a damage bug, or a tooltip bug, either way report it
Whenever you want to report a damage bug, please screenshot the bugged damage with this!
- added is_bonus_element_damage boolean for damage data, this way you can avoid adding flat damage boosts to bonus damages
- made block chance not require shields, I feel it's too constricting that an entire defense layer needs a specific item?
- added some new supp gems
- temporarily removed the bonus ele dmg from mobs, but uncommon mobs now have 1 affix instead of 0
Will monitor player tankiness after ascendancy release
- added new item corruptions
- item corruptions cant be same 2 affixes now

v.5.5.1

- max elemental resist should now reflect correctly in the elemental resist stat
- soul modifiers can now be applied to non crafted souls
- added experimental effect duration overlay
- magic shield users should now get knocked back on hit
- QOL improvements to supp gem screen
- add radius for dmg spells on tooltip
- added possibly seizure inducing indicator that should hopefully help newbies learn how to socket a spell (Idk how to make a decent "flashing" button)
- death penalty now only activates after level 25, for both xp loss, xp debt, favor loss and rested xp loss
- added new highlights if you have points to spend

v.5.2.1
- default dimension config datapack added

v5.2.2
- fix supp gems


v5.2.3
- fix supp gems

v.5.2.4
- should fix spells sometimes not hitting targets when hitting a wall or the floor
- reduced map mob dmg per tier from 0.05 to 0.03
- changed weapon type data in basegears. Now allows you to reduce the amount of checks needed in case you want to make say gun damage from other mods work.
Just set source check to ANY, and tag_and_id_check check to MATCH_ANY and include whatever the bullet's dmg id is ideally.
If it's doing something dumb like directly attacking as a player, you can also skip this tag check and just allow the damage by setting tag check to ANY
- basic attacking with a weapon like bow will now act as an unarmed attack, but you will benefit from the weapon damage, just not the damage multiplier of the weapon
- added experimental new stat panel that shows a lot of useful info like:
	- min, max, softcap amounts
	- what the stat actually does (if it supports localized tooltips)
	- what event it works on and it's priority

- renamed mmorpg_dimension_config datapack to mmorpg_dimension to avoid confusion. just rename your folder if you used any
same with mmorpg_entity_config > mmorpg_entity
- added map_mob_list datapacks. 
- added tags to map dungeon types. By default, all maps and all mob lists have a "default" tag meaning they can spawn anywhere
But you're free to make say a mob list containing spiders spawn only in a spider forest dungeon, or maybe some modded mobs..?
